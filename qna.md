# Dark Mode Implementation - Fixed Issues

## Problems Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Missing Dark Mode Configuration**
- **Issue**: Tailwind CSS wasn't configured for dark mode
- **Fix**: Added `darkMode: 'class'` to `tailwind.config.js`

### 2. **Hydration Mismatches**
- **Issue**: Theme state was managed locally in Navigation component, causing hydration issues
- **Fix**: Created centralized `ThemeProvider` with proper mounting checks

### 3. **Flash of Unstyled Content (FOUC)**
- **Issue**: Dark mode wasn't applied before page render, causing brief flash
- **Fix**: Added inline script in layout head to set theme immediately

### 4. **Inconsistent Theme Persistence**
- **Issue**: Theme preferences weren't properly saved and restored
- **Fix**: Implemented proper localStorage handling with fallback to system preference

### 5. **Missing System Theme Detection**
- **Issue**: No automatic detection of user's system theme preference
- **Fix**: Added media query listener for system theme changes

### 6. **ThemeProvider Context Error**
- **Issue**: Navigation component was trying to use useTheme hook before ThemeProvider was mounted
- **Fix**: Created NavigationWrapper component that waits for ThemeProvider to be fully mounted

## Implementation Details

### ThemeProvider Component (`components/ThemeProvider.tsx`)
- Centralized theme state management
- Exposes `mounted` state to prevent context errors
- Handles system theme changes automatically
- Provides context for all components

### NavigationWrapper Component (`components/NavigationWrapper.tsx`)
- Conditionally renders Navigation based on ThemeProvider mounted state
- Shows loading skeleton during initial mount
- Prevents "useTheme must be used within a ThemeProvider" error

### Navigation Component Updates
- Removed local theme state management
- Uses `useTheme` hook from ThemeProvider
- Added proper accessibility attributes
- Improved theme toggle button

### Global CSS Improvements (`app/globals.css`)
- Added smooth transitions for theme changes
- Improved focus ring styling for dark mode
- Added color-scheme CSS properties
- Enhanced component styling consistency

### Layout Updates (`app/layout.tsx`)
- Added ThemeProvider wrapper
- Uses NavigationWrapper instead of Navigation directly
- Included FOUC prevention script
- Proper theme initialization before render
